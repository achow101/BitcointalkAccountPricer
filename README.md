# BitcointalkAccountPricer
Price Estimator for Bitcointalk Forum Accounts

## Introduction
This project is an attempt to provide accurate pricing information for the trading 
of Bitcointalk Forum Accounts. It will be updated to reflect the market frequently.

## Algorithm
Below is the algorithm used to determine the price of an account

    0.0003 btc/activity
    0.00015 btc/epa (extra potential activity)
    
    epa = potential activity - activity
    
    bp (base price) = 0.0003 * activity + 0.00015 * epa
    
    final price = bp * pqm * tm
    
    pqm (post quality multiplier) determined by ratio of good posts (>75 characters excluding quoted text) to bad posts (<75 characters excluding quotes)
    excellent post quality (90%) = 1.05 (+5%)
    good (80%) = 1.025 (+2.5%)
    fair (70%) = 1.00 (+0%)
    poor (50%) = -1.025 (-2.5%)
    very poor (<50%) = -1.05 (-5%)
    
    tm (trust multiplier)
    positive light green trust = 1.10 (+10%)
    positive dark green trust = 1.20 (+20%)
    neutral trust = 1.00 (+0%)
    negative trust = -0.15 (-85%)

## Disclaimer
Although I strive to produce accurate estimates, this estimator is by far not definitive. It may not 
reflect what sellers are actually selling the accounts for. Furthermore, this estimator excludes specialty accounts
such as Staff, Default Trust, and Satoshi.
